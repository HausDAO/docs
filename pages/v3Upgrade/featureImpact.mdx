# v2 App Feature Impact

v2 metadata and boost settings are stored in a centralized database that we are deprecating. We are also also deprecating one of our sub-graphs to cut down on query fees. This includes the centralized API that pushes this data.

## Summoner

- v2 summoning will be removed from the interface.
- New DAOs are [summoned](https://summon.daohaus.club/) on Moloch v3 contracts.

## Metadata

- Deprecating v2 infrastructure will render DAO metadata immutable.
- Your DAO metadata will no longer be editable after the snapshot.

This includes:

- DAO name, description, tags, social links
- Avatars
- Custom Themes
- Proposal Playlists

## Boosts
