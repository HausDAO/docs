#### Summoner

- v2 Summoning will be turned off.
- All new DAOs will be on Moloch v3 contracts.
- v2 metadata relies upon centralized infrastructure. We are deprecating this infra and v2 DAOs will no longer function.

#### Metadata

- Deprecating v2 infrastructure will render DAO metadata to be immutable.
- All your DAO metadata will no longer be editable after the snapshot.
  - Proposal Playlist
  - Name, description, tags, social links
  - Avatar
  - Custom UI Themes
- v2 metadata relies upon centralized infrastructure.

---

This is a big one. We need to communicate the date of the snapshot and make sure to notify DAOs.

#### Boosts

- We shut off new activation of Boosts.
- You will no longer be able to add any new boosts to your DAO, or edit any currently active boosts.
- Existing boosts will remain active. DAObooks and MintGate will no longer be functional. Eventually many of the boost features may no longer be accessible or experience technical issues.
- Boost activation and settings are tracked on a centralized database, that we are deprecating along with all the rest.

##### Discord Notifications

- Will continue to maintain
- Have not set a deprecation date
