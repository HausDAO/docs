# Summon App

[Summon App](https://summon.daohaus.club/) allows users to launch new DAOs on supported chains.

## Overview

Summon is a Vite React application with TypeScript for summoning DAOs using the Baal (Moloch v3) contract. Designed to be as decentralized as possible, the Vite app is able to be built and hosted on any service.

This app utilizes several of our libraries, including _DAOhaus Connect_, _TX Builder_, and our _DAOhaus Component Library_.

## Running Locally

To run Summon locally, clone the monorepo and use `nx run summon-app:serve` to run a local server on `localhost:3000`. This will start a local server and development environment. Summoner uses Vite as the build tool, so if you're not familiar with Vite we recommmend exploring the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
