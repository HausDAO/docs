## DAOhaus and DAO Terminology

todo:

- delegate
- safe
- voting and non voting

### **Dilution Bound**

If enough members of a DAO ragequit during a proposal's grace period, the transaction may not execute. The proportion of members that must ragequit for this to occur is determined by the dilution bound. A dilution bound of 3, means that if 1/3 of the membership rage quits, the proposal will not pass.

### **Grace period**

The length of time between a proposal passing and when a proposal is ready for processing. It is set by the DAO at summoning, and it ensures that members have ample time after a proposal has passed to **ragequit**, pulling funds out of the treasury if they choose.

### **GuildKick**

Converts any Shares into Loot, removing voting power while maintaining economic stake.

### **Loot**

Grants proportionate ownership of core treasury, without the voting rights.

### **Proposal**

A transaction can be created, configured and put forward to the DAO for voting. The transaction will only execute if the proposal passes.

### **Proposal Offering**

The number of tokens that must be deposited to sponsor a proposal.

### **Ragequit**

Burn some amount of shares and/or loot in exchange for proportionate amount of tokens in the DAO. One doesn't have to burn all shares, and can ragequit any amount at anytime.

### **RageKick**

Same as Ragequit, but enforced by other members and burns all shares and loot, returning their proportionate stake to their internal balance.

### **Voting Tokens (Shares)**

Grants voting rights and proportionate ownership of core treasury. Each DAO has its own process for distributing shares to its members.

### **Non-Voting Tokens (Loot)**

Grants proportionate ownership of core treasury without voting rights. Each DAO has its own process for distributing loot to its members.

### **Summon**

Create a new DAO

### **Summoner**

The original member or members who create the DAO.

### **Structural Benevolence**

The structure of the organization prevents or cannot be used to prejudice certain members by nature of the organizational structure.
