# Summoning a DAO with DAOhaus V3

Introduction:
Learn how to summon a DAO using the DAOhaus V3 platform. This guide will help you understand the various parameters and settings available to create a customized and efficient decentralized autonomous organization.

Step 1: Preparation
Before summoning your DAO, carefully consider the different parameters you want to set within your organization. Changes after this point will require a DAO vote.

Step 2: Summon a DAO
Visit https://summon.daohaus.fun/ and connect your wallet to get started. Choose from various networks, such as Ethereum Mainnet, Optimism, Polygon, Gnosis, and Arbitrum.

Step 3: Understand DAO Settings
Primary settings for DAOhaus V3 include:

    Shares and Loot: Both shares and loot are now ERC-20 tokens, offering full composability and compatibility with ERC20-based apps and protocols.
    Removed Pull Pattern: Sending funds through a proposal and ragequit no longer requires a second step of the receiver withdrawing funds.
    Shamans and Extensibility: Shamans are external contracts that the DAO can approve for special permissions, enabling a new design space for DAO formation and governance.
    Governance Parameters: All governance parameters are now adjustable by the DAO (via proposal) or by a governor shaman.
    Flexible Proposals: Moloch v3 proposals have arbitrary execution, enabling interaction with any smart contract.
    Gnosis Safe: Using the Zodiac pattern, a Moloch v3 DAO can use a Gnosis Safe as its treasury, supporting all on-chain assets.
    Advanced Ragequit: Share- and loot-holders can now choose which tokens they want to receive when ragequitting, removing the need for the DAO to approve tokens before receiving/spending them.

Step 4: Summoning Process
The summoning process is now simplified, with the templates for fun and hard mode replaced by a form to fill out with the necessary information, as described in the slide deck above.

Step 5: Customization
For advanced users who need more customization, consider reaching out to the DAOhaus community on Discord for support.

Conclusion:
With the updated features and enhanced flexibility of DAOhaus V3, summoning a DAO is now more accessible and efficient than ever. By understanding the various settings and parameters, you can create a customized and powerful decentralized organization tailored to your specific needs.
