# How to Summon a DAO on DAOhaus V3

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of summoning a DAO on DAOhaus V3. The previous Hard and Easy Modes and templates are no longer available in V3. Instead, there is a simple form to fill out for summoning a DAO. Let's get started!

**1. Visit the DAOhaus Summon Page**

Go to [https://summon.daohaus.fun/](https://summon.daohaus.fun/) and connect your wallet to the chain you wish to summon on, provided DAOhaus is deployed to that chain. (See here for a list of chains DAOhaus is deployed on: [make a link])

**2. Fill Out the Form**

- Complete all fields in the form. Those marked with a \* are mandatory.

- Basic Settings

  - DAO Name
  - Stake Tokens (Stake tokens represent both voting weight and economic stake within the DAO.)
  - Voting Token Name: What does your DAO want to name the tokens representing voting stake?
  - Voting Token Symbol: How would your DAO like to abbreviate the tokens representing voting stake?
  - Non-Voting Token Name: What does your DAO want to name the tokens representing non-voting stake?
  - Non-Voting Token Symbol: How would your DAO like to abbreviate the tokens representing non-voting stake?
  - Voting stake: Should DAO members be allowed to transfer voting stake to other accounts? After summoning, the DAO can change this with a proposal.
  - Non-Voting Stake: Should DAO members be allowed to transfer non-voting stake to other accounts? After summoning, the DAO can change this with a proposal.

- Proposal Timing

  - Voting Period: How long should proposals remain open for voting?
  - Grace Period: How long is the period between proposal approval and execution? This provides time for members to ragequit their shares before approved proposals are executed.

- Advanced Governance

  - Quorum %: What is the minimum percentage of DAO members (voting stake) required to approve a proposal for it to be executed? This percentage can greatly affect DAO operations. After summoning, the DAO can change it with a proposal.
  - Min Retention %: What is the maximum percentage of DAO members (voting and non-voting stake) required to remain in the DAO after grace period? If the percentage falls below this number, the proposal is not executed.
  - Sponsor Threshold: What is the minimum number of voting stake tokens a member needs to sponsor a proposal?
  - New Offering (ETH): Would you like to require a fee to submit proposals? This feature is intended to protect against spam proposals. Fees in the form of native asset go into the DAO treasury.

- Starting Members, you must have at least one member to summon. Add other summoning members as desired. Members can be added later through a proposal.

  - Input member list with member address, voting stake amount, and non-voting stake amount per row using spaces. Example: 0x00000000000000 20 0 0x00000000000000 10 0

- Starting Shamans
  - Shamans are powerful and have control over key components of the DAO. Use caution in the spirit world.

3. Review and Summon

- After the form has been completely filled out, review your entries to ensure everything is correct. When you're ready, click the **Summon A DAO** button.

4. Confirm the Transaction

- Click confirm on your wallet to start the transaction. Gas fees apply. After a few moments, your transaction will complete, and you can click the "View DAO" button to see your DAO.

5. Update DAO Settings

- In the DAO settings, which can be accessed by clicking on "More" and then "Settings," you can change settings from the summoning (if the DAO approves them). If you click the "Update Setting" button in the "Metadata Card," you can provide important information about your DAO, such as the name, description, and links to your DAO's social media and website.
- Once you have made the changes, click "Submit" to start the process with your wallet.

**Congratulations, you have summoned a DAO on DAOhaus!**
