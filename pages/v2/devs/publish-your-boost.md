# How to Publish Your Boost 

Here is a 4-step process for all Boosts to go from being just an idea to being published on the DAOhaus Boost Marketplace.
1. Get Started :books: 
2. Build your Boost :hammer_and_wrench: 
3. Boosts Review :mag: 
4. Go-Live! :confetti_ball: 

## 1. Get Started 
If you are a developer and want to build Boosts or integrate with DAOhaus, here are some resources to get started: 
* [How DAOhaus works](./)
* [Tutorial: Build a Boost](build-a-boost) 

We'd love to find out more about what you are building and how we can help. Do hop into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/daohaus)'s' and give `@arentweall` and `@UI369` a ping! 

## 2. Build your Boost 
As you are building your Boosts, we'd love to support your integration however we can. Please ping`@arentweall` and `@UI369` in our `#dev-rel` channel if you need any help.

## 3. Submit your Boost for Review 
To ensure all Boosts have a coherent and user-friendly experience, we review all Boosts before they are published on the DAOhaus platform. 

When you are ready to publish your Boost on the DAOhaus Marketplace, create a Pull Request on the [daohaus-app repository](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app) with the "boost/`boostName`" naming convention.

The review process will take approximately 2 weeks.

## 4. Go-Live! 
Once the review process is completed and your Pull Request has been merged, your Boost will now be available on the Boosts Marketplace! 

To announce the launch of your Boost, we'd like to give your Boost marketing support. Typically, we will tweet and introduce your Boost to the DAOhaus community. 

To explore and work on such marketing support, please reach out to `@arentweall`
