Form Legos are composed of Transaction Legos and Field Legos. Once complete, a form can collect information from the user and trigger a transaction to a smart contract. 

> See an example [Form Lego](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app/pull/1819/files#diff-70d9ba3ecba1f7489b1daf832fca1769464202bc653493a0c509eb2d3e43779d) in the [Mint a Million Tutorial](/docs/devs/build-a-boost)

#### Form Blueprint

```js
  MEMBER: {
    id: 'MEMBER',
    title: 'Membership Proposal',
    description: 'Proposal for DAO membership',
    type: PROPOSAL_TYPES.MEMBER,
    required: ['title', 'sharesRequested'], // Use name key from proposal type object
    tx: TX.SUBMIT_PROPOSAL,
    fields: [
      [FIELD.TITLE, FIELD.DESCRIPTION, FIELD.LINK],
      [FIELD.SHARES_REQUEST, FIELD.TRIBUTE],
    ],
    additionalOptions: [
      {
        ...FIELD.APPLICANT,
        label: 'Applicant',
      },
      FIELD.LOOT_REQUEST,
      FIELD.PAYMENT_REQUEST,
    ],
    customValidations: ['nonDaoApplicant'],
  }
```

This blueprint shows a few of the Form Lego features:

- It specifies some basic info needed to render the form: `id` `title` `description`
- It specifies the Proposal Type, which will impact how the resulting proposal renders in the app
- It takes in a TransactionLego `TX.SUBMIT_PROPOSAL` to handle contract execution when the form submits.
- It arranges the fields that appear on the form
- It handles validation for which fields are `required`.
- It specifies an entry in `customValidations`
