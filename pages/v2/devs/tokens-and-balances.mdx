# Treasury, Minions & Safes 

#### **Treasury** 

A Moloch DAO is able to hold ERC-20 and ERC-721 assets. Members of a DAO can withdraw their their proportional ownership of the treasury using the ragequit feature.

The DAOhaus app displays token balances and prices from the DAO treasury. ERC-20 token prices are fetched from Coingecko's price APIs and the token icons are fetched from TrustWallet's repository.

#### **Minions**
A minion is a smart contract that enables the DAO to make arbitrary calls to external smart contracts. A minion is also able to hold ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens within the internal balance, but these funds are not ragequittable by DAO members. 

When a Minion Proposal is submitted, voted on and passed, the Minion will execute the instructions contained in the Minion Proposal, enabling trustless voting and execution.

#### **Safe Minions**
DAOhaus has integrated with the Gnosis Zodiac framework to create the Safe Minion, where a DAO can store funds in a Gnosis Safe but use the Minion to control the Safe through proposals. 

The Minion inherits the `Module.sol` contract from the Zodiac library. When a Minion Propsal is passed and executed, the Minion uses the Moduleâ€™s `exec` function to execute arbitrary external calls on behalf of the Safe.
