## Treasury Overview 

The Treasury is your DAO's treasury account, which supports ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFTs.

If your Treasury Vault holds NFTs, there will be a gallery to view all your DAO's NFTs.

The Treasury Vault only supports ERC-20 tokens, so if you are going to be receiving native tokens such as ETH, MATIC and XDAI on the respective networks, you will need to: 
* Get senders to wrap the tokens before sending (e.g. WETH, WXDAI, WMATIC)
* Install our Wrap N Zap Boost which automatically wraps tokens for you 
* Hold native tokens in a Minion 

## How Ownership Works

All members share direct ownership of the treasury based on their Shares and/or Loot in relation to one another. Shares grant **voting power** as well as a claim to the Treasury funds, whereas Loot only grants you rights to the funds in the Treasury. 

To help you visualise, here is an example of a simple DAO with 600 DAI in the Treasury.

| Member | Shares | Loot | Voting Power | Exit Value |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Alice  | 10     | 0    | 25%          | 100 DAI    |
| Bob    | 10     | 10   | 25%          | 200 DAI    |
| Chris  | 20     | 0    | 50%          | 200 DAI    |
| Dani   | 0      | 10   | 0%           | 100 DAI    |
| Total  | 40     | 20   | 100%         | 600 DAI    |

In the above example, as Bob has 10 / 40 shares, he has 25% of voting power. If he wants to withdraw from the treasury, he can claim 33% of the funds (200 DAI) because the sum total of his Shares + Loot take up 33% of the total. 

As Dani has no Shares, she has no voting power. If she wants to withdraw from the Treasury, her 10 loot grants her 16% of the Treasury funds (96 DAI)

When members RageQuit or are Guild Kick-ed, this is how their Exit Amounts are calculated


## Minion Vaults 

Another way to hold funds is through Minions. Minions enable your DAO to call arbitrary contracts, enabling you to do many things such as manage ENS, collect NFTs, manage treasury in DeFi, etc. As Minions can also hold ERC-20 tokens, they are useful for holding funds that will eventually interact with smart contracts (e.g. Payroll, Superfluid, etc.)

For more information on Minion, please refer to the [docs here](minion).

As the Minion balance is separate from the Treasury's balance, the Exit Amount during RageQuits do not take into account Minion Balances. The DAO will need to calculate the Member's fair share of the Treasury + Minion Balances to ensure accuracy in Exit Amounts.


## Common Treasury Use Cases 

**Adding & Whitelisting ERC-20 Tokens**

The Treasury Vault can support valid ERC-20 tokens, but for it to show on the Treasury Vault UI, you will need to submit and pass a Proposal to whitelist the token. Once the token is whitelisted, the Treasury should show the ERC-20 tokens. 

**Adding Tributes to join a DAO**

When new members would like to add tributes to join, you will need to submit a Membership Proposal and indicate your tributes provided and shares requested. Currently, only ERC-20 tributes are available, but ERC-721 NFT tributes are coming soon.  

**Requesting Funding from the Treasury**

If you'd like to request funding from the Treasury, submit a Funding Proposal and indicate the funds owed to you.
