## DAOhaus and DAO Terminology

### **Boost**

Add-ons available through the Boost Marketplace that augment DAOhaus functionality.

### **Dilution Bound**

If enough members of a DAO ragequit during a proposal's grace period, the transaction may not execute. The proportion of members that must ragequit for this to occur is determined by the dilution bound. A dilution bound of 3, means that if 1/3 of the membership rage quits, the proposal will not pass. 

### **Internal Balance**

Funds that are claimable from your **Member Profile** which have been released to you through a funding proposal from the DAO.  You may claim those funds from your **Member Profile** on [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.gg)

### **Grace period** 

The length of time between a proposal passing and when a proposal is ready for processing. It is set by the DAO at summoning, and it ensures that members have ample time after a proposal has passed to **ragequit**, pulling funds out of the treasury if they choose.

### **GuildKick**

Converts any Shares into Loot, removing voting power while maintaining economic stake.

### **Loot**

Grants proportionate ownership of core treasury, without the voting rights.

### **Proposal**

A transaction can be created, configured and put forward to the DAO for voting. The transaction will only execute if the proposal passes. 

### **Proposal Deposit**

The number of tokens that must be deposited to sponsor a proposal. These are typically refundable. 

### **Ragequit**

Burn some amount of shares and/or loot in exchange for proportionate amount of tokens in the DAO. One doesn't have to burn all shares, and can ragequit any amount at anytime.

### **RageKick**

Same as Ragequit, but enforced by other members and burns all shares and loot, returning their proportionate stake to their internal balance.

### **Shares**

Grants voting rights and proportionate ownership of core treasury. Shares are DAO specific and cannot be transferred or traded. Each DAO has its own process for distributing shares to its members.

### **Summon**

Create a new DAO

### **Summoner**

The original member or members who create the DAO.

### **Structural Benevolence**

The structure of the organization prevents or cannot be used to prejudice certain members by nature of the organizational structure.
