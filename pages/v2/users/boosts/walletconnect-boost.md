### Description 

The ability to make external contract calls is a powerfully important option for your DAO to have.  

This functionality is currently available through the DAOhaus Safe Minion Transaction Builder proposal type. 

The WalletConnect Boost leverages the power of WalletConnect to make it even easier for your DAO to interact with external contracts.
