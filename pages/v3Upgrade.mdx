# We have news to share - DAOhaus v3 has risen!

You can learn all about the upgrade [here](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/bcJCN2H7vow6xRE977A4pTWUNR0vqrgTscFLtu2ttn8)

DAOhaus believes that the best tools to empower DAOs are open-source and publicly owned. Decentralization is our north star. We learned a lot while developing v2 and applied to create more decentralized and open tech stack for v3.

What does this mean for all your v2 DAOs? Not much, the DAOhaus v2 interface will live on at [app.daohaus.club](https://app.daohaus.club/), but we will be spinning down some of the features that rely on centralized infrastructure. Over the next couple of months we will be depreacting the following features:

- v2 DAO summoning (why v2 when you can v3?!?)
- v2 DAO metadata editing (dao name/description/ect, custom themes, proposal playlists)
- v2 Boost activation (boosts already activated will be available)
- Advanced UI features like vault charts, activity feeds, explore page filtering

So, while you can keep operating your v2 DAO, we think this is the perfect time to take your DAO to the next level and upgrade to v3!

Here are some common upgrade [paths](https://moloch.daohaus.fun/features/migrations)

And we are also happy to help guide you through this. Drop a line in the DAOhaus [discord server](https://discord.gg/daohaus) #v3-migration channel and let's head north!
