We have glorious news to share - DAOhaus v3 has risen!

You can learn about the upgrade [here](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/bcJCN2H7vow6xRE977A4pTWUNR0vqrgTscFLtu2ttn8).

DAOhaus believes tools to empower DAOs should be open-source and publicly owned. Decentralization is our north star. We learned a lot developing v2 and prioiritized creating a more decentralized and open tech stack for v3.

What does this mean for all your v2 DAOs? The DAOhaus v2 interface will live on at [app.daohaus.club](https://app.daohaus.club/), but we will be removing some of the features that rely on centralized infrastructure.

Over the coming months we are depreacting the following v2 features:

- [Summoner](/v3Upgrade/featureImpact#summoner)
- [Metadata](v3Upgrade/featureImpact#metadata)
- [Boosts](v3Upgrade/featureImpact#boosts)
- [Advanced UI](v3Upgrade/featureImpact#advanced-ui)

While you _could_ keep operating your old smelly v2 DAOs, we think this is the perfect time to upgrade to a fresh new v3!

Read more about the [features](/v3Upgrade/featureImpact) we are removing and how it will impact your DAOs.

We have charted some common upgrade [paths](v3Upgrade/migrate) for your community to consider.

We are also happy to help guide you through this. Drop a line in the DAOhaus [Discord server](https://discord.gg/daohaus) `#v3-migration` channel and let's head north!
